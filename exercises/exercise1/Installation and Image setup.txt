NOTE: Although you should be able to run these commands on any Docker version on any Linux Distribution, for the purposes of these exercises, be sure you are running Docker v1.10+ as well as the latest CentOS or Ubuntu distribution. Be sure to have pulled the 'centos:6' and 'ubuntu:latest' images from the Docker Hub (docker pull) before starting this exercise.

1. Create a directory called 'custom' and change to it. In this directory, create an empty file called "Dockerfile".
2. Edit the "Dockerfile" created in Step #1 above. This configuration file should be written to perform the following actions:

    Use the base Centos 6 Latest version image from the public repository
    Identify you and your email address as the author and maintainer of this image
    Update the base OS after initial import of the image
    Install the Open-SSH Server
    Install Apache Web Server
    Expose ports 22 and 80 to support the services installed

3. Build the custom image from the 'Dockerfile' as created above. Name/tag this new image as "mycustomimg/withservices:v1". Once the image is built, verify the image appears in your list.
